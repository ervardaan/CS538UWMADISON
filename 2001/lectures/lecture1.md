# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT-BASIC STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF PLs

## Scheme

- A modern variant of Lisp.
- A Functional Language: Functions are
“first class” data values.
- Dynamically Typed: A variable’s type
may change during execution; no
type declarations are needed.
- All memory allocation and
deallocation is automatic.
- Primary data structures, lists and
numbers, are unlimited in size & may
grow without bound.
- Continuations provide a novel way to
suspend and “re-execute”
computations

## ML (“Meta Language”)

- Strong, compile-time type checking.
- Types are determined by inference
rather than declaration.
- Polymorphic (one function
declaration can be used with many
different types).
- Pattern-directed programming (you
define patterns that are automatically
matched during a call).
- Typed exceptions are provided.
- Abstract data types, with
constructors, are included

## Prolog (Programming in Logic)

- Programs are Facts and Rules.
- Programmers are concerned with
definition, not execution.
Execution order is automatically
determined.
## Pizza

- Extends a popular Object-oriented
language, Java, to include
- Parametric polymorphism (similar to
C++’s templates)
- First-class functional objects
- Algebraic data types, including
patterns.

## Python

- A simple, efficient scripting language
that quickly build new programs out
of existing applications and libraries.
- Cleanly includes objects.
Scales nicely into larger applications.

### 1)programs were written in absolute machine code—a sequence of bits that encode machine instructions

### 2) Symbolic Assemblers

- Allow use of symbols for operation
codes and labels.

### 3) Fortran (Formula Translator)-1950

### 4) Cobol (Common Business Oriented Language)-1960

### 5) Algol 60 (Algorithmic Language)-1960

### 6) Lisp (List Processing Language)-1960

### 7) Simula 67 (Simulation Algol)-1967

### 8) C-1970 and C++ - 1980 mid

### 9) Java-1990 late

## programming paradigms

- Procedural Languages
    - Most of the widely-known and
widely-used programming languages
(C, Fortran, Pascal, Ada, etc.) are
procedural in nature.
  - Programs execute statement by
statement, reading and modifying a
shared memory.
  - This programming style closely
models conventional sequential
processors linked to a RAM

- Functional Languages
      - Lisp, Scheme and ML are functional
in nature.
    - Programs are expressions to be
evaluated.
    - Language design aims to minimize
side-effects, including assignment.
    - Alternative evaluation mechanisms
are possible, including
Lazy (Demand Driven) AND 
Eager (Data Driven or Speculative)

- Object-Oriented Languages
      - C++, Java, Smalltalk, Pizza and
Python are object-oriented.
    - Data and functions are encapsulated
into Objects.
    - Objects are active, have persistent
state, and uniform interfaces
(messages or methods).
    - Notions of inheritance and common
interfaces are central.
    - All objects that provide the same
interface can be treated uniformly. In
Java you can print any object that
provides the toString method. You
can iterate through the elements of
any Java object that implements the
Enumeration interface

- Logic Programming Languages
      - Prolog notes that most programming
languages address both the logic of a
program (what is to be done) and the
control flow of a program (how to do
what you want).
    - A logic programming language, like
Prolog, lets programmers focus on a
program’s logic without concern for
control issue.
    - These languages have no real control
structures, and little notion of “flow
of control.”
    - What results are programs that are
unusually succinct and focused
