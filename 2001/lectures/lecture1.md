# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT-BASIC STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF PLs

## Scheme

- A modern variant of Lisp.
- A Functional Language: Functions are
“first class” data values.
- Dynamically Typed: A variable’s type
may change during execution; no
type declarations are needed.
- All memory allocation and
deallocation is automatic.
- Primary data structures, lists and
numbers, are unlimited in size & may
grow without bound.
- Continuations provide a novel way to
suspend and “re-execute”
computations

## ML (“Meta Language”)

- Strong, compile-time type checking.
- Types are determined by inference
rather than declaration.
- Polymorphic (one function
declaration can be used with many
different types).
- Pattern-directed programming (you
define patterns that are automatically
matched during a call).
- Typed exceptions are provided.
- Abstract data types, with
constructors, are included

## Prolog (Programming in Logic)

- Programs are Facts and Rules.
- Programmers are concerned with
definition, not execution.
Execution order is automatically
determined.
## Pizza

- Extends a popular Object-oriented
language, Java, to include
- Parametric polymorphism (similar to
C++’s templates)
- First-class functional objects
- Algebraic data types, including
patterns.

## Python

- A simple, efficient scripting language
that quickly build new programs out
of existing applications and libraries.
- Cleanly includes objects.
Scales nicely into larger applications.

### 1)programs were written in absolute machine code—a sequence of bits that encode machine instructions

### 2) Symbolic Assemblers

- Allow use of symbols for operation
codes and labels.

### 3) Fortran (Formula Translator)-1950

### 4) Cobol (Common Business Oriented Language)-1960

### 5) Algol 60 (Algorithmic Language)-1960

### 6) Lisp (List Processing Language)-1960

### 7) Simula 67 (Simulation Algol)-1967

### 8) C-1970 and C++ - 1980 mid

### 9) Java-1990 late

## programming paradigms

- Procedural Languages
    - Most of the widely-known and
widely-used programming languages
(C, Fortran, Pascal, Ada, etc.) are
procedural in nature.
  - Programs execute statement by
statement, reading and modifying a
shared memory.
  - This programming style closely
models conventional sequential
processors linked to a RAM
