# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT-BASIC STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF PLs

## Scheme

- A modern variant of Lisp.
- A Functional Language: Functions are
“first class” data values.
- Dynamically Typed: A variable’s type
may change during execution; no
type declarations are needed.
- All memory allocation and
deallocation is automatic.
- Primary data structures, lists and
numbers, are unlimited in size & may
grow without bound.
- Continuations provide a novel way to
suspend and “re-execute”
computations

## ML (“Meta Language”)

- Strong, compile-time type checking.
- Types are determined by inference
rather than declaration.
- Polymorphic (one function
declaration can be used with many
different types).
- Pattern-directed programming (you
define patterns that are automatically
matched during a call).
- Typed exceptions are provided.
- Abstract data types, with
constructors, are included

## Prolog (Programming in Logic)

- Programs are Facts and Rules.
- Programmers are concerned with
definition, not execution.
Execution order is automatically
determined.
## Pizza

- Extends a popular Object-oriented
language, Java, to include
- Parametric polymorphism (similar to
C++’s templates)
- First-class functional objects
- Algebraic data types, including
patterns.
