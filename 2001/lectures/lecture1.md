# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT-BASIC STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF PLs

##Scheme

- A modern variant of Lisp.
- A Functional Language: Functions are
“first class” data values.
- Dynamically Typed: A variable’s type
may change during execution; no
type declarations are needed.
- All memory allocation and
deallocation is automatic.
- Primary data structures, lists and
numbers, are unlimited in size & may
grow without bound.
- Continuations provide a novel way to
suspend and “re-execute”
computations
